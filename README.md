Want to give your website a modern, dynamic feel? Try adding a parallax scrolling effect! Parallax effect makes background images move at a slower speed than the foreground, creating a 3D depth illusion as you scroll.

Here's a quick breakdown of how to create the parallax effect:

HTML Structure: We set up sections for the parallax background and the content that users will scroll through.
CSS Magic: By applying background-attachment: fixed; to the background image, it stays in place while the rest of the page scrolls, giving the illusion of movement.
This effect can instantly add a professional and immersive feel to your website.
